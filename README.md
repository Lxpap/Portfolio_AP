# Alex's Portfolio: Skunkwwworks

## Description 

This is a first iteration of my personal portfolio, with mostly concept projects for the time being. As time passes and I gain more experiences and builds that I can show, they will be uploaded to it, and it will also be transforming with new technologies and capabilities. At the moment, it is created solely with HTML, CSS, and ❤️.

## Application

The application can be found live on [GitHub Pages](https://lxpap.github.io/Portfolio_AP).

## Usage 

The application features a quick menu in the top right, a gallery of projects with their relevant links embedded in the middle, as well as a contact section that you can use to get in touch with me down at the bottom.
